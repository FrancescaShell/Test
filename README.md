###Open air quality

In this repository you can find a file named ‘main.py’ that queries the air quality measurements provided by a web-accessible API in order to get the value of some polluting molecules within European cities.

If you execute the main file by running the program with: 

‘python main.py -a example -p example -c example -m example’

It will give you this kind of result:
	
‘$ python3 main.py -a example -p example -c example -m example
Successful log-in. Welcome example!
16.043478260869566’

##Note: 
1.	In case the user forgets to specify the parameter, the one of default is “pm10”
2.	The project requires the following modules: argparse, sqlite3, hashlib, random, requests, json, csv, unittest and sys.


###Get started!
Registration is required!
In order to access information you need to: 
1. open the ‘scripts’ file;
2. register with a username and a password.
‘$ python dbmanager.py -a test -p test  
The registration had been successful’


###Arg
Positional arguments
*username*: name of the user to log-in

Optional arguments
•	*-v*, *--verbosity*: output verbosity.
•	*-p*, *--password*: user password to log-in.
•	*-c*, *--city*: name of the European city.
•	*-m*, *--molecule*: symbol of the polluting parameter. 

###Documentation
The source of our documentation is the on-line site Openaq; it provides air composition data updated from time to time by other sites. 

To join the program, you can choose:
- a *city*, in the list of European cities
- a *parameter*, from the set of molecules. 

Cities and parameters are stored in ‘pypackage’ as .csv files; respectively in ‘cities.csv’ and ‘parameters.csv’
